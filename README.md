Interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction. Large dataset that consists of 129,880 customers and includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. This uses a binomial **logistic regression** model I also experimented with **Machine Learning** models such as a Decision tree model, Random Forest Model and XGBoost Model to help the airline model and better understand this data.
